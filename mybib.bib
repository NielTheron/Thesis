Such platforms are being used for several space applications, such as education, Earth remote sensing, science, and defense. As of May 31st, 2018, 855 CubeSats had been launched. Remote sensing application is the main sector in which CubeSats are being used, corresponding to about 45% of all applications. This fact indicates the commercial potential of such a platform. Fifty eight countries have already been involved with developing CubeSats. The most used CubeSat configuration is 3U (about 64%), followed by 1U (18%), while 6U platforms account for about 4%. In this paper, we present an analysis of the current situation regarding CubeSats worldwide, through the use of a dataset built to encompass information about these satellites. The overall success rate of the CubeSat missions is increasing over time. Moreover, considering CubeSat missions as a Bernoulli experiment, and excluding launch failures, the current success rate was estimated, as a parameter of a binomial distribution, to be about 75%. By using a logistic model and considering that the launchings keep following the current tendency, one can expect that one thousand CubeSats will be launched in 2021, within 95% certainty.},

   abstract = {In less than a decade, Cubesats have evolved from purely educational tools to a standard platform for technology demonstration and scientific instrumentation. The use of COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) components and the ongoing miniaturization of several technologies have already led to scattered instances of missions with promising scientific value. Furthermore, advantages in terms of development cost and development time with respect to larger satellites, as well as the possibility of launching several dozens of Cubesats with a single rocket launch, have brought forth the potential for radically new mission architectures consisting of very large constellations or clusters of Cubesats. These architectures promise to combine the temporal resolution of GEO missions with the spatial resolution of LEO missions, thus breaking a traditional trade-off in Earth observation mission design. This paper assesses the current capabilities of Cubesats with respect to potential employment in Earth observation missions. A thorough review of Cubesat bus technology capabilities is performed, identifying potential limitations and their implications on 17 different Earth observation payload technologies. These results are matched to an exhaustive review of scientific requirements in the field of Earth observation, assessing the possibilities of Cubesats to cope with the requirements set for each one of 21 measurement categories. Based on this review, several Earth observation measurements are identified that can potentially be compatible with the current state-of-the-art of Cubesat technology although some of them have actually never been addressed by any Cubesat mission. Simultaneously, other measurements are identified which are unlikely to be performed by Cubesats in the next few years due to insuperable constraints. Ultimately, this paper is intended to supply a box of ideas for universities to design future Cubesat missions with high scientific payoff. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Even though the payload is designed for Earth observation and to capture man-made patterns on the ground as the main mission, a secondary mission is planned for the classification of wildfire images by the convolution neural network (CNN) approach. Therefore, KITSUNE will be the first CubeSat to employ CNN to classify wildfire images in LEO. In this study, a deep-learning approach is utilized onboard the satellite in order to reduce the downlink data by pre-processing instead of the traditional method of performing the image processing at the ground station. The pre-trained CNN models generated in Colab are saved in RPi CM3+, in which, an uplink command will execute the image classification algorithm and append the results on the captured image data. The on-ground testing indicated that it could achieve an overall accuracy of 98% and an F1 score of a 97% success rate in classifying the wildfire events running on the satellite system using the MiniVGGNet network. Meanwhile, the LeNet and ShallowNet models were also compared and implemented on the CubeSat with 95% and 92% F1 scores, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrated the capability of small satellites to perform CNN onboard in orbit. Finally, the KITSUNE satellite is deployed from ISS on March 2022.},

In this research, a swarm of small satellites (called “Children S/C″), deployed from a larger platform (called “Mother S/C″), is employed in the inspection of a damaged spacecraft, which cannot be directly approached by the Mother S/C for safety reasons. The navigation process is delegated to the Mother S/C, that is equipped with a passive camera. A navigation algorithm runs on the Mother S/C, which identifies and tracks the Children S/C framed in the scene, even though false matches (i.e., incorrect tracking of a given child) could happen. The navigation algorithm is made robust through the generation at each time step of a propagated virtual image (based on the previous estimate of the swarm state) which is compared to the acquired image for the correct identification of each child. When the relative position estimates reach a satisfactory accuracy, the Mother S/C communicates to the Children S/C their current state and an optimal impulsive control strategy can be implemented to make the swarm fulfill the required inspection task. Simulations are carried out in a purposely developed software environment, in which images of rendered CAD models are acquired and processed to have a realistic validation of the estimation algorithm, showing satisfactory performance and robustness for the overall mission accomplishment.},

Dual poses including center position and normal direction can be obtained from a single perspective view of a radius-known circle such as docking ring of the satellite. To solve the duality and recover the roll angle, this paper presents here a new method called perspective circle and line (PCL), which is based on the perspective view of a single circle and line. First of all, the dual center positions and normal directions are recovered with the circle and the image. Then, the line is utilized to recover the roll angle of the circle analytically. By reprojecting a random point on the line to the image and verifying whether the projection lies on the image line, the false pose of the object is identified. Simulation and physical experiments show that the position and orientation of the circle can be recovered. But in practice they are affected by the accuracy of camera calibration and feature extraction. As a whole, PCL is robust to noise in pose estimation, especially in recovering the orientation.},

Examples of this are the chip scale atomic magnetometer, magnetic tunnel junctions with MgO barriers, and a device for minimizing the effect of 1∕f noise, the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) flux concentrator. In the chip scale atomic magnetometer, researchers have been able to fabricate the light source, optics, heater, optical cell, and photodiode detector in a stack that passes through a silicon wafer. Theoretical and subsequent experimental work has led to the observation of magnetoresistance values of 400% at room temperature in magnetic tunnel junctions with MgO barriers. This large magnetoresistance occurs because electrons in the majority band can tunnel more easily through the MgO barrier than electrons in the minority band. The MEMS flux concentrator has the potential to increase the sensitivity of magnetic sensors at low frequencies by more than an order of magnitude. The MEMS flux concentrator does this by shifting the operating frequency to higher frequencies where the 1∕f noise is much smaller. The shift occurs because the motion of flux concentrators on MEMS flaps modulates the field at kilohertz frequencies at the position of the sensor. Though miniaturization is generally beneficial, trade-offs are necessary because some properties, such as noise, worsen with decreasing size.},

   abstract = {An algorithm for very accurate absolute positioning through Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite clock estimation has been developed. Using International GPS Service (IGS) precise orbits and measurements, GPS clock errors were estimated at 30-s intervals. Compared to values determined by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the agreement was at the level of about 0.1 ns (3 cm). The clock error estimates were then applied to an absolute positioning algorithm in both static and kinematic modes. For the static case, an IGS station was selected and the coordinates were estimated every 30 s. The estimated absolute position coordinates and the known values had a mean dierence of up to 18 cm with standard deviation less than 2 cm. For the kinematic case, data obtained every second from a GPS buoy were tested and the result from the absolute positioning was compared to a dierential GPS (DGPS) solution. The mean dierences between the coordinates estimated by the two methods are less than 40 cm and the standard deviations are less than 25 cm. It was veri®ed that this poorer standard deviation on 1-s position results is due to the clock error interpolation from 30-s estimates with Selective Availability (SA). After SA was turned o, higher-rate clock error estimates (such as 1 s) could be obtained by a simple interpolation with negligible corruption. Therefore, the proposed absolute positioning technique can be used to within a few centimeters' precision at any rate by estimating 30-s satellite clock errors and interpolating them.},

A Coarse Sun Sensor consisting of six solar cells placed on each of the six outer surfaces of the satellite is used for Surr vector determination. This robust and low cost setup is sensitive to surrounding light sources as it sees the whole sky. To compensate for the largest error source, the Earth, an albedo model is developed. The total albedo light vector has contributions from the Earth surface which is illuminated by the Sun and visible from the satellite. Depending on the reflectivity of the Earth surface, the satellite's position and the Sun's position the albedo light changes. This cannot be calculated analytically and hence a numerical model is developed. For on-board computer use the Earth albedo model consisting of data tables is transferred into polynomial functions in order to save memory space.

Most satellites use solar power as a source of energy, and so need to make sure that solar panels are oriented correctly with respect to the sun. Also, some satellites have sensitive instruments that must not be exposed to direct sunlight. For all these reasons, sun sensors are important components in spacecraft attitude determination and control systems. To minimize components and structural mass, some components have multiple purposes. The solar cells will provide power and also be used as coarse sun sensors. A coarse Sun sensor is a low-cost attitude determination sensor suitable for a wide range of space missions. The sensor measures the sun angle in two orthogonal axes. The Sun sensor measures the sun angle in both azimuth and elevation.

In this review paper, we provide an introduction to the relevant instruments and their applications. We consider past and present magnetometers, their proven aerospace applications, and emerging uses. We then look to the future, reviewing recent progress in magnetometer technology. We particularly focus on magnetometers that use optical readout, including atomic magnetometers, magnetometers based on quantum defects in diamond, and optomechanical magnetometers. These optical magnetometers offer a combination of field sensitivity, size, weight, and power consumption that allows them to reach performance regimes that are inaccessible with existing techniques.

In the algorithm's first stage, the TRIAD uses the available vector measurements (e.g. from Sun sensor and magnetometers) to estimate a coarse attitude. In the second stage, these estimated values are used as quaternion measurements in the UKF algorithm, together with the angular rate measured by a triad of gyros. The state vector for the UKF is composed of the attitude parameters, gyro biases and the magnetometer error terms. In result, we get fine attitude estimate for the satellite by calibrating the magnetometers in real-time. Rather high computational load of the algorithm, mainly due to the additional states, is decreased by filter reconfiguration. We evaluate the algorithm for a hypothetical nanosatellite by numerical simulations. The results show that the attitude of the satellite can be estimated with accuracy better than 0.5deg and the magnetometers can be fully calibrated.},

Approach is demonstrated by simulation where the position of the satellite is obtained with the Simplified General Perturbations Version 3 model and its orientation by simulating its dynamic and kinematic models. For a known position and orientation of the satellite the images are obtained using the satellite's onboard camera, simulated by the Google Earth application. The orientation of the satellite is governed by reaction wheels, which produce the required moments to the satellite. The image-based control law using SIFT image features is applied to achieve an automatic reference-point observation on the Earth's surface.

In this paper, it is presented a relationship that give us the coordinates of the point of intersection of the line of sight scanning system and the Earth's surface as a function of: terrestrial ellipsoid surface, satellite position, satellite velocity, satellite attitude (spatial situation) and orientation of the scanner. The input parameters include the orbital state and attitude information of the satellite and the look vector of the remote sensing sensor. The process for calculating the pixel geolocation (geodetic latitude and longitude) starts with the calculation of the Instantaneous Field-Of-View (IFOV) matrix in sensor coordinates. Then, several rotations are required to obtain the IFOV in the Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinate system. First there is the sensor-to-satellite rotation that obtains the IFOV relative to the satellite. Next there is the satellite-to-orbital (geodetic nadir pointing) rotation that obtains the IFOV relative to the path of the satellite. The transformation between the scan pixel and the ECEF pixel is expressed in terms of a series of consecutive matrix transformations applied to the line of sight vector. Finally, for any scan pixel, we obtain ECEF coordinates (by intersection of the IFOV with the ellipsoid used to model Earth) and then geodetic coordinates (geodetic longitude and latitude).},

   abstract = {A real time TV view finder is used on-board a low earth orbiting (LEO) satellite to manually select targets for imaging from a ground station within the communication footprint of the satellite. The attitude control system on the satellite is used to steer the satellite using commands from the groundstation and a television camera onboard the satellite will then downlink a television signal in real time to a monitor screen in the ground station. The operator in the feedback loop will be able to manually steer the boresight of the satellite's main imager towards interested target areas e.g. to avoid clouds or correct for any attitude pointing errors. Due to a substantial delay (in the order of a second) in the view finding feedback loop and the narrow field of view of the main imager, the operator has to be assisted by the onboard attitude control system to stabilise and track the target area visible on the monitor screen. This paper will present an extended Kalman filter used to estimate the satellite's attitude angles using quaternions and the bias vector component of the 3-axis inertial rate sensors (gyros). Absolute attitude sensors (i.e. sun, horizon and magnetic) are used to supply the measurement vectors to correct the filter states during the view finder manoeuvres. The target tracking and rate steering reaction wheel controllers to accurately point and with high agility stabilise the satellite, will be presented. The controller reference generator for the satellite-to-target attitude and rate vectors, as used by the reaction wheel controllers, will be derived. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

However, basic problems such as fast and robust geo-localization in GPS-denied environments still remain unsolved. Existing research has primarily concentrated on improving the accuracy of localization at the cost of long and varying computation time in various situations, which often necessitates the use of powerful ground station machines. In order to make image-based geo-localization online and pragmatic for lightweight embedded systems on UAVs, we propose a framework that is reliable in changing scenes, flexible about computing resource allocation and adaptable to common camera placements. The framework is comprised of two stages: offline database preparation and online inference. At the first stage, color images and depth maps are rendered as seen from potential vehicle poses quantized over the satellite and topography maps of anticipated flying areas. A database is then populated with the global and local descriptors of the rendered images. At the second stage, for each captured real-world query image, top global matches are retrieved from the database and the vehicle pose is further refined via local descriptor matching. We present field experiments of image-based localization on two different UAV platforms to validate our results.},

An effective strategy is the innovative utilization of existing sensors. This study investigates a novel application of Earth sensors for autonomous position and attitude determination enabling them as a viable option for autonomous navigation in low-cost micro/nano-satellites through computer vision technology. To address large resolution differences and distortions between sensed infrared images and reference maps, this paper presents a coarse-to-fine matching framework that integrates deep learning features and area-based registrations. First, CNN-based registration and optimization techniques are utilized for coarse registration. A modified VGG16 (M-VGG) and a multiscale pyramid information fusion (MPIF) module are employed to extract and describe deep abstract features, enhancing robustness. Subsequently, edge-based extended phase correlation is employed for fine registration. Finally, the ultimate position and attitude parameters are determined by integrating the results from coarse and fine registration. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated using synthetic images. An analysis of 342 images demonstrates sub-pixel registration accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.9322 km for position and 0.1185° for attitude.},

Wrong attitudes lead to inaccurate map projections and measurements that require post-processing correction. In this study, we propose an automated and robust scheme that derives the satellite attitude from its observation images and known satellite position by matching land features from an observed image and from well-registered base-map images. The scheme combines computer vision algorithms (i.e., feature detection, and robust optimization) and geometrical constraints of the satellite observation. Applying the proposed method to UNIFORM-1 observations, which is a 50 kg class small satellite, satellite attitudes were determined with an accuracy of 0.02◦, comparable to that of star trackers, if the satellite position is accurately determined. Map-projected images can be generated based on the accurate attitudes. Errors in the satellite position can add systematic errors to derived attitudes. The proposed scheme focuses on determining satellite attitude with feature detection algorithms applying to raw satellite images, unlike image registration studies which register already map-projected images. By delivering accurate attitude determination and map projection, the proposed method can improve the image geometries of small satellites, and thus reveal ﬁne-scale information about the Earth.},

There is therefore an increasing need to develop high accuracy attitude systems that do not breach small satellite mass and cost constraints. This paper proposes a novel method for determining attitude or rates over three axes using low cost, low mass, Earth-pointing pushbroom sensor pairs. The technique is applicable to existing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites with the appropriate camera systems, such as the Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) multispectral imager. The effects of attitude on satellite push-broom imagery are modelled, with inversions detailing the extraction of rates. Simulations show that using a suitable sub-pixel level registration scheme, such as Phase Correlation, with DMC imagery, attitude position accuracies in the order of a few arcminutes are achievable. Simulations have also shown pitch and roll rates of around an arcsecond per second to be measurable. Results using DMC imagery confirm the viability of using conventional, off-the-shelf, cameras onboard small satellites to determine attitude position and rates to a high level of accuracy.},

The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and ﬁnally performing veriﬁcation through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters.

	abstract = {This paper presents a finite difference based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for real-time estimation of twoline elements (TLE) to be used in satellite mission. Three finite difference approximation methods are used to compute the highly nonlinear Jacobian matrix of the simplified perturbation propagator (SGP4). The three methods are the fourth order central-difference, second order forwarddifference and second order backward-difference approximations. In addition, a line search weightage has been implemented to ensure the state estimates do not violate the boundary constraint during the Kalman filtering update process, such as negative eccentricity. The TLE estimation’s accuracy and average computational time of the proposed finite difference based EKF methods have been compared with other optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and interior-point method (IPM). Results have shown that the average TLE estimation error of the proposed approach is at least two magnitudes lower than IPM, PSO and GA. In addition, the proposed method has the lowest computational time, and is at least 12 times faster than PSO and GA.},

	abstract = {Earth Observing System (EOS) spacecraft will make measurements of the earth's clouds, oceans, atmosphere, land and radiation balance. These EOS spacecraft are part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Mission to Planet Earth, and consists of several series of satellites, with each series specializing in a particular class of observations. This paper focuses on the EOS AM-1 spacecraft, which is the first of three satellites constituting the EOS AM series (morning equatorial crossing) and the initial spacecraft of the EOS program. EOS AM-1 has a stringent onboard attitude knowledge requirement, of 36/41/44 arc seconds (30) in yaw/roll/pitch, respectively.},

	abstract = {The study of satellite performance evaluation can reveal the ability of satellite systems to fulﬁl corresponding tasks in the space environment, and provide information support for the resource allocation and mission scheduling of in-orbit satellites. In this paper, we took the satellite attitude control system in attitude tracking mode as the research object. In accordance with the system’s mission requirements, the control performance evaluation indicator set, characterized by a generalized grey number, is constructed to tackle the uncertainty and inadequacy of information contained in ﬂight status data resulting from the complex space operating environment and sensor measurement noise. An improved principal component analysis method based on generalized grey number is proposed to solve the weight ampliﬁcation caused by the correlation between performance indicators and realize the weight allocation of the indicators. Finally, the grey-target decision model is established to determine the weights of the performance indicators, and the performance evaluation model is established under the tracking mode. The feasibility of the grey-target decision-evaluation model based on the improved principal component is conﬁrmed through comparative experiments.},
