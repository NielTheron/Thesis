For future work more indef develop needs to be done for cloud matching and masking as my system really
- Proper Feature matching
In this work there is a huge gap left open in the feature matching scope. In this work feature mathcing was considered "prefect" using the raycasting method. 
But in reality there would be a feature mathcing component and a on-board database generation component also seen in the literature 


- Dynamic features
- Cloud masking
- Robust Feature Detection
- The ET system only works on cicular orbits
- System can by simplified to use phase estimation instead of full Catersian estimation
- Different Types of Biomes
- More accurate models
- Field Testing
- Lens Correction
- Computational Analysis
